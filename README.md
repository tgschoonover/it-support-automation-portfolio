# IT Support + Automation Portfolio (Python-first)

This repo shows job-ready IT support fundamentals and “improver” skills:
- Ticket-style troubleshooting writeups (how I diagnose + resolve common issues)
- SOPs/checklists (repeatable processes)
- Automation scripts (Python-first) to reduce repetitive work

## Structure
- /tickets — troubleshooting writeups in a consistent template
- /sops — SOPs and checklists
- /scripts — automation scripts (Python-first)
- /lab-notes — hands-on notes from practice

## Principles
- I sanitize outputs (no personal data, passwords, private keys, or employer-specific details).
- I document what I tried, what I observed, and why the fix worked.
